## 📁 Folder Overview
Each file in this folder explains a different use of the this keyword through basic and educational examples.

### 📌 File Descriptions
### ➤ 1. ThisKeywordExample.java
Demonstrates how this is used to refer to instance variables when local variables (like method parameters) have the same name.
#### 🔹 Avoids confusion between local and instance variables.

### ➤ 2. ThisAsArgument.java
Shows how this can be passed as an argument to another method or constructor.
#### 🔹 Useful when an object needs to refer to itself for callbacks or object sharing.

### ➤ 3. ThisWithConstructor.java
Illustrates how this() can be used to call another constructor from the same class.
#### 🔹 Helps in constructor chaining to avoid code duplication.

### ➤ 4. ThisReturnCurrentObject.java
Shows that a method can return this to return the current class object.
#### 🔹 Commonly used in method chaining (like obj.setA().setB()).
